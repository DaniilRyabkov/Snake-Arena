## All of this game code was made useing JS. A little bit of HTML was used for the webstite structure. 
I've made a Similar Game before that was also a snake game but this version is much better.
## Controls: The game is only playable on pc or anything that has a keyboard connected to it.
 To move around you use the arrow keys ↑ ↓ → ←.
### Some basic rules of the game.The goal of the game is to collect as many carrots as you can without crashing into the walls or your own tail. 
Evey time you eat an apple using your head of the snake you get +1 score and your tails beomes bigger by 1.
### Note that if you are going up you cant go down right away. Same with going right to left right away it wont work.
